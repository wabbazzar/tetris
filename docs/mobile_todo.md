1. **Use mobile browser dev tools** (Safari/Chrome remote debugging)
2. **Verify touch coordinates** with visual overlay
3. **Check gesture thresholds** (distance, timing, velocity)
4. **Test on actual devices** - simulators can't replicate touch behavior
5. **Monitor touch event frequency** - avoid over-firing
6. **Use haptic feedback** for debugging gesture recognition

### Mobile Performance Issues
1. **Profile with mobile dev tools** (Safari Web Inspector/Chrome DevTools)
2. **Monitor frame rate** during touch interactions
3. **Check memory usage** on mobile browsers
4. **Test with slow 3G** connection simulation
5. **Verify touch responsiveness** with timing measurements
6. **Use mobile-specific performance APIs**

### Cross-Device Compatibility Issues
1. **Test iOS Safari quirks** (viewport, touch events, styling)
2. **Test Android browser differences** (Chrome vs Samsung Internet)
3. **Check device-specific features** (haptics, PWA support)
4. **Verify responsive breakpoints** on real devices
5. **Test orientation changes** and safe areas
6. **Document device-specific workarounds**
